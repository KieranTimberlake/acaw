What is the sound of today's terracotta? How can its porosity, geometry, surface coating, and assembly be manipulated to tune a soundscape? And can such a surface amplify the human experience of urban open space? Led by KieranTimberlake, this project will assemble a transdisciplinary team to model, simulate, prototype, and test an urban terracotta soundscape.
